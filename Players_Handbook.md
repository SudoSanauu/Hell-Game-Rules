# The Hell Game

## Intro
The Hell Game is a Role Playing Game I've been working on for a few years that I'd like to play with your if you're reading this. I originally wrote some self indulgent nonsense here, but suffice to say if you know me you probably have an idea what it will be like: fun absurdities at some times, self serious nonsense in others. On the fun side its a silly game where you'll get to run around fighting devils and make stupid jokes with friends. On the more serious side I'd like to make a game which makes some commentary on our world, our games, and maybe even changes the way that we engage with and think about our table top experiences. If you want to read what I wrote before, here it is for posterity's sake:

>It will be an experience (hopefully) somewhere between hideous torture and exuberant fantasy. Together we will (hopefully) talk to otherworldly terrors and simple relatable people, explore a world in which there are no shackles of morality to hold you down since everyone gets their just desserts, and explore a plane of meaningless existence where everything has a purpose.

Below are the rules of a game about a group of people who wake up on the First Layer of Hell and delve their way down to the Ninth. I tried to write a new system stealing ideas from everything I like including AD&D, OSR, 5e, modern indie RPG's, and anything else which got in the way at the time. After reading this broad overview I hope to have given you some knowledge of how to play the game and an idea of if you would like to play.


## I. What is Hell?
In this game, at the end of their days, everyone gets what they deserve, and where they end up fits the life they led. Hell is one of the places where people who we can all agree are Evil end up. Hell is not for those who randomly destroyed and lashed out at the world, reveling in and creating meaninglessness, since those souls end up in the all consuming Abyss. Hell is instead the nine layered pit where those who did terrible things with a purpose end up; a place for those filled with desire, passion, and the willingness to do anything to achieve their dream. Hell is not just terrible, it is terrible with a greater purpose.

Since Hell is a terrible place, terrible people and terrible actions are all around. In this horrible existence "bad" decisions almost always turn out better than what people consider to be "moral". Mercy is almost never shown, since it always brings about betrayal. Everyone has been trained to take advantage of any goodwill and thoughtfulness shown towards them, lest they simply open themselves up to be taken advantage of. Perhaps one could be "good" in Hell, rising above the petty actions, the betrayals, and the pure undeserved cruelty, but it would be for all but naught: Hell's only rewards would be an internal smugness and much external hardship.

With positive benefits removed from positive behavior, Hell provides a wonderful place to ask questions about our understanding of morality and how to act in the face of Evil. Characters will be forced to answer if they would be heroic if no one is watching and no one cares. With the Hell game I hope to provide a sandbox where characters can battle with these ideas and questions while players can contemplate and consider them.

Another aspect of Hell is that its metaphysics are significantly different from those of the "normal" world. Being the afterlife, Hell's physics don't stem from the same physical interactions we see in the real world, but instead are a result of the effect of belief on reality. Rocks fall, fire burns, and F = ma not because of fundamental unbreakable laws, but instead because the inhabitants of the plane (consciously or unconsciously) believe that they will. The consequences of this effects not only physical interactions, but also everything in Hell. How smart one is is a direct consequence of how intelligent everyone (including the person in question) thinks they are. Training may make one more powerful, but only because of the interpersonal proof of competence and personal confidence it provides. This concept is baked into the structure of the game and will come up often.

Another metaphysical quirk of Hell is that its inhabitants are only dead souls. This means that unlike common understandings of metaphysics on the material planes there is no soul/body duality in Hell's entities, since they are just all soul. Hell's denizens instead break up entities into 3 parts, Material, Mind, and Mouth. Material is the stuff which makes up people: their hair, their muscles, their horns. Physical stats, physical actions, and one's Humanity all fall under the scope of the Material. Mind is instead the internal state of the a being. What they're thinking at any given time, their plans, and their personal Traits and abilities. Finally Mouth is the outward understanding of Hell's occupants. The outward image that one projects, how others interpret those projections, and the Adjectives used to describe something are all components of Mouth. These three components come together to create the inhabitants of Hell and how they exist in the plane, and is a concept which can be used to better understand how things work.

## II. Who are you?
### i. Character Rules
If you're reading this then chances are you're interested in being a core member of the campaign as the game goes on. The current plan is to have three to five core members of the party who can make it to most/all of the biweekly sessions and are willing to talk about, think about, answer questions about, and maybe even roleplay their characters in-between sessions. The goal is to have each of the characters be at least two dimensional with ideas, views, goals, and mannerisms different than their players, and perhaps even to be three dimensional with their own doubts, flaws, and ways of thinking. If this sounds like too much but you are still interested in being a part of the group in some way I'm planning on having opportunities to be a guest/recurring/cameo character or be involved in the game in another way which may work better.

If you decide to be one of the core members you can choose your character from one of the nine premade options. These have their mechanical aspects defined and a vague start to their backstory waiting to be fleshed out. The intention here is not to unduly constrict your creativity, but instead to provide help outlining an idea of the tone, themes, and mechanics of the campaign while reminding everyone that they can't undo the sins they committed before they arrived in Hell. Below I will generally explain what is on the character sheets and how each part works to help you get an idea of which characters you may want to play before giving an overview of each of the characters and then a description of how each session will generally function. More detailed information on the premade characters is in the characters folder on the GitHub where you're presumably reading this.

#### Stats
Each character will have the classic six D&D stats which each mean approximately the same thing they do in that game as they do here. Each stat provides a bonus or penalty on checks and actions related to them based on its value (bonus/penalties done like in 3rd-5th edition D&D). In addition to stats, this system also shares the ideas of levels with D&D. Each character will start at 1st level with significant progress or actions earning them an experience point. After five such points are accumulated they will gain a level giving them additional hit points and access to or changes in powers based on who they are.

Each character also has a list of actions which they get to add their level to when making checks. These can be thought of as what the character is proficient in from their former life. They also have a list of actions which they only have some skill in which they instead add half their level (rounded up) to.

#### Traits	
Each character also starts with two Traits, one at Rank 2 and one at Rank 1. Traits represent how the character sees and understands themselves in the world; a kind of quantified sense of self. If a character takes an action which falls in line with a Trait they posses they can add their level as a bonus to the action if they couldn't before (or half the level if the relatedness is kind of a stretch). In addition, each Rank of the Trait also provides the character with a new action they can take. The 1st Rank only provides the character the opportunity to make a check to take an action (usually outside of tense combat situations) while the 2nd Rank gives them an action to take automatically even in tense situations. Ranks 3, 4, and 5 each provide another possible action to take, each more extreme, powerful, and reality breaking than the last. The Rank of the Trait represents how ingrained in the character's psyche this aspect of who they are is. A Rank 1 Trait may be almost subconscious while Rank 5 Trait is a fully embraced almost all encompassing ideal which dominates the character's every waking and sleeping thought.

Throughout play, a character's actions can change how they see themselves, and so change their Traits and those Trait's Ranks. At the end of each session, everyone will talk about how their characters' views have changed over the course of the game and come together to decide if its caused a change in them. Each Trait will have an progress bar which can be raised or lowered based on if the character's actions have reinforced or contradicted the Traits they already have. Once that bar reaches 5 points the Trait will Rank up, going up (to a maximum of Rank 5) and needing another five points to achieve the next Rank. If a bar ever goes below zero points the Trait instead Ranks down (with a Rank Zero Trait simply being removed). If a character with less than three Traits exhibits behavior which is fitting of gaining a Trait for two sessions in a row, the character acquires the new Trait at Rank 1.

As Traits Rank up the behavior necessary to gain progress and increase Rank will become more and more extreme. An action which would have granted a point at Rank 1 may be necessary to simply stay at Rank 4 without loosing progress. The possibility of gaining and loosing Traits means that though a character may not be who they (or you) want them to be at the start of their journey, they can change through consistent action and patience. Changes in Traits shouldn't be surprising rewards or punishments so much as the logical consequences of the actions which characters take throughout the game. Since Traits represent the internal thoughts of characters, discussions on how they change should center the character's player, since they can best understand the internal thoughts of their character.

#### Adjectives
In addition to up to three Traits, characters can also have up to three Adjectives which represent how everyone else views them. Since belief makes reality each Rank in an Adjective effects all the actions of a character, giving them a +1 per Rank to any check which lines up with the Adjective. In addition these Adjectives effect how a character's actions happen. Starting at Rank 2 each Adjective changes how any action which they provide their bonus to looks. Someone who is Sneaky may slip a baby a stick to replace the lollipop they steal from them while a Ruthless character will no doubt rip it from their crying hands. This also extends to how character look just standing around with everyone in Hell being able to immediately know exactly what their Adjectives are. At Rank 3 and 5 Adjectives will also begin to apply their bonuses to specific things outside of checks, whether these are static numbers or rolls which would otherwise be unaffected.

Since the game starts with the character's arrival in Hell none of them start with any Adjectives, however, just like Traits their actions in game can cause them to gain them. Each Rank is gained all at once from significant actions taken by a character which cause them to gain a reputation. These reputations don't have to be accurate to what the character actually behaved like, only to how they are viewed by Hell and its inhabitants. When figuring out how a character's Adjectives may have been effected at the end of a session the discussion should center everyone besides the character's player, since Adjectives represent how others see a someone as opposed to how they see themselves.

#### Humanity
In Hell, each character also has a Stage in Humanity they are currently at. When a character first arrives in Hell they start at the Stage closest to Human: Person. As the many hardships of Hell continue to effect the characters and they stop behaving as if they are living beings their Humanity will falter and lower. This makes them appear less whole, vibrant, and alive, instead becoming more worn out, tiered, and corpse-like. At the end of each session if a character hasn't taken the necessary actions to uphold their current Stage of Humanity it will decay down a Stage: from Person to Wanderer, from Wanderer to Scavenger, and finally from Scavenger to Lost Soul. Each Stage requires less and less in order to maintain, and are better at surviving the day to day horrors of Hell. Though a Person may require a mask to keep Hell's sulfurous fumes from burning their throat, a Wanderer would be used to the pain, and won't even need to drink water to keep themselves from deteriorating to the Scavenger Stage. At the Stage of Lost Soul the only thing a character needs to do to maintain their position is have the will to live. If this is too much then the character gives up and stops being a playable entity in Hell, instead finding a place to lie down and become a part of the landscape. Perhaps they are tortured for eternity as the old man sleeping over his drink at the bar, unable to wake from their drunken stupor. Perhaps they sit down and never get up, eventually being eaten by and becoming a gnarled and spiky bush. Perhaps they simply lie in a field and are ground into dust, becoming the very substance of Hell, tread upon by and choking the throats of every other tortured being who comes after them.

Humanity can also be lost if the character takes a grievous wound which they couldn't otherwise recover from. The details of this will be further covered when talking about play below, but if a character takes a wound and doesn't have another way to recover from it, they can heal it and return to full health by going down a Stage of Humanity. It is also possible to go up the track. If a character takes a human action significantly above what is needed for their current Stage of Humanity, whether that be easting a lavish meal, taking a spa day, or something else equally refreshing, they can go up to the next Stage. Alternatively, such a lavish expenditure can be used to heal all injuries as one would by loosing a Stage without actually losing it.

In addition to the Human side of the scale, characters can also decide to instead become more Fiendish, and try to become a Devil. Just like increasing Humanity, increasing Fiendishness requires the character to spend above and beyond what is needed. Unlike Humanity, increasing Fiendishness requires the character to become Diabolical by acting like a Devil: usually through torturing another and consuming the horrible and terrifying creations of Hell. These stages go instead from Lost Soul to Nuisance to Tormentor to Fiend. Just like Humanity, greater and greater upkeep (of the Devilish kind) is required to keep these Stages and they can be sacrificed to heal. Unlike Humanity, the more Diabolical a character becomes the easier it is for them to exist in Hell. They become protected from its fires or other "natural" obstacles. Instead of looking more and more like a corpse, a Fiendish character will look more and more monstrous and Diabolical. Other Fiends will treat them less like a mark, target for torture, or meal and instead will see them as a rival to be feared, respected, or envied.

| Name      | What is Required to Maintain                       |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Person    | Healthy living conditions, Constant water and food |
| Wanderer  | Food from time to time                             |
| Scavenger | Breathable air                                     |
| Lost Soul | The will to live                                   |
| Nuisance  | Verbally abusing someone worse off than you        |
| Tormentor | Indulging yourself at another's expense            |
| Fiend     | To be a Fiend of Wealth and Taste                  |


#### Powers
Finally every character comes with a unique power which defines something only they can do. Each of these are different, so I suggest reading the summary of each of them to give you an idea of how they work and then the character sheet itself for further details. Each of these determine the main thrust of what playing each character is like, and often incorporate their own unique mechanics with the mechanics introduced above.

### ii. Character Examples

## III. How does the game work?
So I've done a lot of rambling about all these systems and ideas, but how does the game actually play? How do things go down, what dice are rolled, how does it all work? This is the section where I'll try to talk about all that. There are going to be many things which are left unsaid or not given enough detail to actually play. Part of this is may be that I probably haven't thought about the question you're asking, part may be that I haven't gone into so much detail to keep this document readable, and part may be that I haven't decided how I want it to go down yet. The great thing about running your own system is if we need answers to questions we can decide them for ourselves. I'm hoping here to give a broad enough outline to let people understand the other things I've written and to also decide if they would like to play or not.

### i. Structure
The overarching structure of the game which I envision is a trek of characters from the First Layer of Hell, where they wash up after their death, all the way down to the Ninth Layer where they will finally be able to meet with its Lord and perhaps achieve their goals. Though each individual character's reason for delving deeper will be unique, the need to reach the 9th is driven by the fact that in Hell any true change can only be achieved by reaching the bottom. The structure of Hell naturally divides our story into nine different parts, one for each layer. The pacing, themes, and mechanics of each layer will vary widely, but the general mechanics and ideas outlined in this document should remain relatively constant. 

Its likely that between each layer I will have to take a break to get everything together for the next one, but excusing that I hope to have sessions regularly every other week when possible. The plan is to end each session early in order to give time to have a debrief/recap about what has occurred and come to an agreement as a group as to how the party has progressed. It is during this recap that we will figure out if the characters change their Experience Points, Traits, Adjectives, Humanity, or any other progress markers that may come up. This is also a great time to get a broad understanding of what will happen for the next game and if any preparations need to be done before the next session. After the game, I plan on writing up a recap to post to Discord in less than a week, containing any specific questions that need to be answered before/at the next session. After posting this the remaining week off can be used to tie up any loose ends, such as any solo actions party members wish to take or figuring out what characters absent from the previous session were doing in the meantime. This is also the time to meet up and discuss the necessary preparations for any non-core members who may want to come for the next week so we can figure out what their roll will be.

At the start of the next session I will provide the recap of the previous one and fill in the players on anything which happened between sessions that they need to know. From there the session itself will start and the process will begin again.

### ii. The Game
I would be lying if I said that I fully know how all of the rules for this game will work through all Nine Layers, since I will be writing and making up a large chunk as things go along. I'll try to give enough of an overview as to not surprise anyone in this section. The basic mechanic which I'll be basing most of the game off of is the same most of D&D: rolling a die, adding bonuses, and then comparing it to a number to try to do a thing. There are the new mechanics as to what can apply bonuses which were talked about above, so I'll outline specifically what most rolls will look like with the following equation:  
d20 + Stat Modifier + Level Bonus + Adjective Bonus + Misc. Modifiers  
Where:  
Stat Modifier is the modifier provided by the Statistic related to the action  
Level Bonus is +lvl if related to Character/Trait, + lvl/2 if kinda related to Character/Trait, or +0 if not related to character  
Adjective Bonus is +Rank of the highest Rank Adjective which matches with the action in question.  

If this sounds confusing, don't worry, I'm sure we'll all get the hang of it after a bit and I'll be there to help you through it.

In addition to die rolls, I'd like to center in game descriptions and plans for actions. Instead of a, "There is a trap," "OK I disarm it," exchange, I'm hoping to spend more time actually describing situations and hoping that players do the same for their characters. This is important because with the addition of Traits and Adjectives, how an action is done can be more important that what is done for the game. If a character with Reckless as an Adjective disarms a trap by throwing a bomb into it they can use it to give them a bonus, while a character sneakily getting an enemy to walk into it to set it off may use this at the end of session debrief as evidence that they should improve the Rank of their Conniving Trait. In the past I have done a poor job of making space for other's ideas when doing this, so I'm planning to focus on being more accepting and generous with allowing things to work than I have been.

Above I mention HP and damage, but don't really explain the system I was thinking of using to make this all happen. In the Hell Game HP will only represent an abstract protection from damage due to rolling with the blow, getting lucky, or otherwise avoiding physical harm. When a character is reduced to 0 HP they don't suffer any immediate negative effects, but all addition damage done to them from now on will cause serious wounds to their body. This is represented by taking the damage dealt and using it as severity for the wound chart in 2nd Edition's Combat & Tactics. In this system critical hits will simply cause increased damage, making them much more likely to cause these sever wounds, but not causing them in and of themselves.

## IV. Why Write Up All These Rules?
Well, I mean, it would be nice if you read them so that when we play the game we are all on the same page, but theres more than that. A big reason is just to have one place to go back to in case I forget what I have said or decided before. In addition, I hope this document has given you a feel for what the game will look like, which hopefully can help you decide if you are interested in playing in it or not. Though I have thought a lot about and worked on this for a long time, none of the rules have actually been play tested and I have shared my thoughts with very few people up to this point, (and the thoughts I have shared often have become abandoned or are no longer relevant to the game as it exists now) so please let me know if you disagree with the ideas presented, don't understand something, or have any other feedback you think would be helpful to me in designing/running this game. RPGs are nothing without players, so please be a part of this experiment with me.

## V. When?
Session 0 and 1 of The Hell Game will be occurring in January 2020.
