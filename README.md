# Welcome to (the) Hell (Game)

This is my compilation of the rules I'm planning on using for the running of the Hell Game. By having them in a public place which also tracks the changes which are made I'm trying to be more transparent and hold myself accountable to recording and noting updates. These updates will be versioned with if its pre/post release, which layer its written on/what major update number, which update it is, and the date (x.x.x_dd-mm-yyyy).
