# Welcome to (the) Hell (Game)

This is my compilation of the rules I'm planning on using for the running of the Hell Game. By having them in a public place which also tracks the changes which are made I'm trying to be more transparent and hold myself accountable to recording and noting updates. These updates will be versioned with if its pre/post release, which layer its written on/what major update number, which update it is, and the date (x.x.x_dd-mm-yyyy).


Currently the Players Handbook is where I want it to be for Session 0, and is a good place to start reading. The classes are still being worked on, but each one has its basic outline and ideas down if you want to get an idea what they are, but exact wordings will probably change.
