#The Rebel

### Description
The Rebel was once an outcast in their community. On the edges of society, they found an organization to belong to which gave them what they needed. They used the knowledge they gained to set up their revenge on the community, which led to the downfall of themselves and everyone else involved.

As the Rebel, you get your power from both your relationships with those you left behind and those you joined in Hell. You start with contacts in the real world and in Hell who you can exchange favors with for power.  

With the Rebel, you are able to play the great game, make trades and deals, and play with the denizens of Hell better than anyone. However, everything you can do relies on having other people to work with.

Examples: Jojo Betzler (if things went significantly worse) from Jojo Rabbit, almost any character from The Spire: City Must Fall

### Charm and Connections
As the Rebel, your magical powers come from the connections you form with both powers greater than and followers less than yourself. By helping out and doing favors for mortals once like you you can form Relationships and gain Tokens of appreciation which grant you power to cast Charms in Hell. These Tokens are also coveted by the powers of Hell, who offer you even more power in exchange for handing them over.  
To start, the Rebel is the only character able to contact entities both inside and outside of Hell all on their own. They can achieve this by performing a private ritual in a secluded area for about half an hour, after which they can communicate with their target. The Rebel starts with three contacts from the world they lived in who are related to their backstory and defined when the game starts. In addition they also have one contact deeper in Hell who they were working with before their death.  

Contacts still in the living world look to the Rebel for help just as the Rebel looked to their contact while they were still alive. Starting out, the Rebel and their contact don't really know each other, and so have a Relationship of Rank 0; however, the Rebel can speak to their contact and do favors for them in order to strengthen their relationship. Ever time the Rebel increases their Relationship Rank this way they get to learn a new Charm of the Rank they increased it to, and they get a Token of the same Rank. Every time a Relationship is strengthened, the favors required to strengthen it get harder and harder, changing from getting a simple item at Rank 1 to a campaign derailing quest at Rank 5. Similarly, the Tokens given to the Rebel start out as small sentimental trinkets like locks of hair or cute poems at Rank 1 while becoming things of huge importance as Ranks increase. This culminates with the contact giving the Rebel their soul as a Token when their Relationship reaches Rank 5.  
In general, the Tokens which you receive are useless to the Rebel on their own, providing them no real power. The Tokens do, however, hold great value for the Rebel's Contacts within Hell, who are willing to trade much for them. At minimum, a Diabolical contact is willing to trade knowledge of a Charm of one Rank higher than that of the Token, though they are also willing to trade away many other favors or things which could also be useful to the Rebel in their journey. Giving such trusted and personal items away to entities in Hell who don't have their best interests at heart will have an effect on the contact on the outside, usually ironically robbing them of what they made their deal to acquire in the first place. In addition to accepting Tokens, diabolical contacts can also give the Rebel new earthly contacts in exchange for the Rebel's services in Hell.

With the power they receive from these relationships, the Rebel is able to prepare and cast Charms, which allow them to effect the reality of Hell through their mastery of relationships and people. This means that their Charms generally work to effect appearances or manipulate people, and usually don't have overt and physical effects. For each Rank of Charm they have access to, the Rebel is able to prepare a number of different Charms of that Rank equal to number on the chart below based on their Level. After preparing said Charms, they may then cast the same number of their prepared Charms in any combination before having to recharge and re-prepare them.  
Since the Rebel's power comes from Relationships and their connections with others, they recharge their Charms by engaging with others. For Rank 1 Charms they don't even have to directly engage with another person, but can even get the spell back from reading a magazine or watching the news for a few minuets. Rank 2 Charms require getting up with the latest gossip with someone, Rank 3 getting into serious news and life events, and Rank 4 and 5 require a deep conversation at least an hour long.  
The Rebel can also cast Charms which are of a higher Rank than they have access to through a long arduous process. The exact details will need to be worked out on a case by case basis, but casting the Charm will require getting a large number of people to do a long and difficult ritual together. The higher the Rank of the Charm, the more people and longer it takes. This can only be used to cast Charms one Rank higher than the Rebel otherwise could.

### Source of Power
The power of the Rebel comes from their understanding of the power of relationships. Everyone says its not what you know, its who you know, but only the Rebel is able to take these relationships and understand them well enough to turn them into something usable.
