# The Fake

### Description
The Fake was once a member of an oppressed group who became someone else in order to escape their tormentors. They committed heinous acts in order to keep their cover until, eventually, their died after living their life as a lie.

As the Fake you are able to take on disguises and personalities in Hell. Each of these can become more or less real, perhaps even eclipsing you in the eyes of everyone else.

Play the Fake if you want to create and cultivate personalities to solve problems while trying to figure out what makes you you in the process.

With the Fake, easy. However, hard.

### Alternate Identities:
As the Fake you have the ability to create and switch between Identities, which each gain a measure of reality in Hell. As these Identities develop and become a part events in Hell, they will become more and less real, and even take on lives of themselves.  
This is represented by a Realness stat, which each different Identity will have. In general, a Realness of 100 or greater means that the entity is understood by Hell and exists fully within it, while Identities with less Realness may just be fake characters. For a general guideline, Identities with less than 30 Realness don't really raise any questions when encountered, but also don't leave an impression, while others will have heard a story from a friend of a friend about Identities with Realness in the 40's to 50's. Once realness gets above that the Identities start making stories for themselves and having material effects on the world. If an Identity ever gets to 100 or more realness it is undeniably an entity in the world who exists. If this is the Fake's Main Identity (Identity with the most Realness) this just means that this identity is "responsible" for the actions the Fake takes when not inhabiting another Identity. If its not the Main Identity, then it also truly exists in Hell, independent of the Fake or any of their other Identities.

Upon arriving in Hell, your Main Identity has all of your starting 125 points of Realness. At any time, you can transfer 10 Realness away from your Main Identity to create a new Identity with a name, an appearance, and a set of mannerisms, and jump into it. Any time after that you inhabit this Identity you can transfer another 10 Realness from your Main Identity in order to grant it one additional rank in any Trait or Adjective. If you wish to destroy an Identity, at the end of each session it wasn't used you can transfer 10 Realness away from any Identity back to your Main Identity. If this (or any other transfer) leaves an Identity with less Realness than is required for it to have a name or its Ranks, the Identity will loose them as is appropriate.
Realness can be gained in a few ways. First, whenever the Fake gains a level, the Realness of their Main Identity will increase by 10. In addition, each of their Identities (Main or otherwise) can gain Traits and Adjectives like any other character, which will result in an increase of 10 Realness for that identity.

Switching Identities requires the Fake to have about a minute in a relatively private area for them to switch over. When in an Identity, unless someone saw you change or another extreme circumstance, others will never recognize you as any other Identity. Whenever you Switch, you can choose a new Stage of Humanity which is no more than one off your Main Identity. This does not actually change your Humanity unless the Identity you are in becomes your Main one, but does change what others will see as your Humanity. Switching grants you any reasonable privileges of the Identity you have switched to, along with access to its Traits and Adjectives. This comes along with the Traits you have in your Main Identity, but you can not use your Main Identity's Adjectives while in another Identity.



### Philosophical BS:
The power of the Fake comes from their understanding that the ultimate function of something is more important than how that function comes about. Nine times out of ten, reality deals with black boxes whose content is unimportant. By knowing and understanding this, the Fake has the power to change the outside of a box without bothering with the inner workings, and so has the power to manipulate how they are perceived and function in the shallow world of Hell.
