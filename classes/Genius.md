# The Genius

### Description
The Genius was a respected and distinguished leader in their field, who was working on an awesome and terrible project for their organization until an outside force came and threatened the Genius, forcing them to be their agent and work against the original organization. Eventually, the Genius' betrayal was discovered, and brought about their demise.  

The Genius's power is to prepare terrible and powerful Spells which they can unleash to great effect. Any number of Spells can be prepared or learned, the only limitation is the Genius' time, resources, and desire to do so.  

With the Genius, you have access to the widest variety of the most potent rituals, and can learn any of them your character wants to. However, your magical abilities rely on the resources available to you, and failure to manage them well could leave you with many problems.

Examples: Walter White from Breaking Bad, Rhialto the Marvelous from Vance's Dying Earth, Elon Musk from The Horror Which is Real Life

### Traits
#### Cowardly ● ● ○ ○ ○

● ● – Can quickly disengage from dangerous situations without provoking any immediate response from the engaged characters.

#### Ingenious ● ○ ○ ○ ○
The Genius is not only very smart, but also apt to apply their intelligence in new and novel ways to solve difficult problems. This character is the sort of person who would give MacGyver a run for their money or fix their car's engine with duct tape and glue instead of buying a new one.  
● – Can check to attempt to solve problems without the necessary tools or materials by describing a work around and a good description of the method used.

### Wizardry
As the Genius your magical powers all come from your ability to understand and exploit the reality of the world around you. This is done by preparing powerful spells ahead of time and then releasing them once ready. There is no limit to the power and number of spells which can be prepared before hand; however, the time and resources required along with the chance of catastrophic failure steadily increase with the ambition of the caster. The Genius' repertoire is also limited to what they can understand themselves doing, meaning some spells will be off limits based on their Traits.
The number and power of the spells which the Genius has easy access to is based on their level, and detailed in the chart below.

| Level | Rank  1 | Rank  2 | Rank  3 | Rank  4 | Rank  5 |
| ----- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
|   1   |    1    |    -    |    -    |    -    |    -    |
|   2   |    2    |    -    |    -    |    -    |    -    |
|   3   |    2    |    1    |    -    |    -    |    -    |
|   4   |    3    |    2    |    -    |    -    |    -    |
|   5   |    4    |    2    |    1    |    -    |    -    |
|   6   |    4    |    2    |    2    |    -    |    -    |
|   7   |    4    |    3    |    2    |    1    |    -    |
|   8   |    4    |    3    |    3    |    2    |    -    |
|   9   |    4    |    3    |    3    |    2    |    1    |

In order to prepare a Spell, the Genius must already know the Spell, must have access to materials to create physical components to store the magic, and then spend time in relative peace. If the Genius currently has less Spells prepared of the Rank than they are allowed, (as can be seen above) then the preparation takes materials which have no cost and only 10 mins per Rank to prepare fully. If the Genius has access to Spells of a given Rank, but already has the above amount (or more) prepared, preparing another takes materials costing 10^(Rank) SP and 1 hour per Rank. If the Spell you are trying to prepare is of a higher Rank than you currently have access to, it costs 10^(Rank + 1) SP, takes 4 hours per Rank, and has a failure chance of 15% for every Rank it is above your max castable Rank. This can be offset by 1% for every Rank in an applicable Trait your character has. This failure chance is rolled only when the prepared Spell is attempted to be cast. If the Spell fails by 10% or less it still occurs but goes a long with a side effect. If the Spell fails by 11% to 20% it simply fails to happen. A failure of more than 20% causes a magical backlash which is catastrophic for the caster and any nearby.

In order to learn new Spells to prepare, the Genius must first make sure that they don't conflict with their Traits. If the Genius wishes to learn a Spell whose powers are at odds with one of their Traits, they must first bring the Trait to Rank zero. Whenever the Genius gains a level, they may learn a new Spell of their devising which matches one of their Traits. When inspiration strikes, they have no need to spend any money and the process only takes 8 hours, regardless of the Spell's Rank. If the Genius already has a copy of the Spell in question, they may learn it simply by taking one day per Rank of the Spell to decipher its contents. Finally, if the Genius wishes to learn a Spell without already having access to a copy of it, they may spend one thousand SP per Rank of the Spell and three days of time per Rank of the Spell. This process has a failure rate equal to if the Genius tried to cast the Spell. (15% per Rank above current possibility - 1% per applicable Trait Rank)

Casting a Spell is as simple as releasing the energy stored in the materials used to prepare it. This means that the materials are used up and destroyed when the Spell is cast and that only prepared spells can be cast. There may be some ways for the Genius to mitigate the failure rate of preparing or learning powerful spells, but these are rare and powerful in the extreme.

| Preparing Spells If...          |  Material Cost  |    Time     | Failure Chance    |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Fits within the chart           |       0 SP      | 10 min/Rank | 0%                |
| Fits within Rank but not number |   10^(Rank) SP  | 1 hour/Rank | 0%                |
| Doesn't fit Rank                | 10^(Rank +1) SP | 4 hour/Rank | 15*ΔRank - Traits |

| Learning Spells If...     |  Material Cost  |    Time     | Failure Chance    |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ------------------|
| Lvl Up + Match Trait      |       0 SP      |   8 Hours   | 0%                |
| Have Copy of Spell        |       0 SP      | 1 day/Rank  | 0%                |
| No Copy of Spell          |   1000 * Rank   | 3 days/Rank | 15*ΔRank - Traits |

| Amount Failed By | Failure results            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| under 10%        | Negative Side Effect       |
| 11% to 20%       |  Harmless Fizzle           |
| over 20%         |   Catastrophic Side Effect |


### Philosophical BS
The power of the Genius comes from their belief that given the time, resources, and will, they can do anything they wish to. They are much more engineer than scientist: more Elon than Einstein. This means that the Genius is a master of reality, who can wield the most powerful forces and cause the most impressive effects, as long as they have enough minutes in the day, dollars in the bank, and shits to give.
