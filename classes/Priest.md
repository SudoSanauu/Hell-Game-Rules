# The Priest

### Description
The Priest was once a respected healer and thinker in their community, but they let it go to their head and became corrupt in their position. Their ego and indulgences eventually caught up with them and caused them to fail their community and, ultimately, led to their demise.  

As the Priest, you can find and define what is true and meaningful in Hell. By specifying a set of beliefs you can control what miracles you have access to and to what you will be held accountable to.  

With the Priest, you have access to a huge number of powerful Miracles which you get to define and choose for yourself. However, you also have a partial responsibility to come up with them while also creating and following an appropriate ideology.

Examples: Dr. Strange, Jordan Peterson

● ● – Can spend your turn saying something dismissive to oppose any check someone else makes.

### Miracles
As the Priest the beliefs and convictions you build up during your time in Hell have the power to change reality. These changes come in the form of Miracles: actions the Priest can take which change the world in a way which aligns with their understanding of reality. The chart below shows how many of each Rank of Miracle they can cast based on their current Level before having to recharge. The Priest doesn't have to choose which Miracles they will use ahead of time since they're able to cast any combination of those they know as long as it follows the chart below.

#### Miracles per Recharge

| Level | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 | Rank 4 | Rank 5 |
| ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1     | 3      | -      | -      | -      | -      |
| 2     | 4      | -      | -      | -      | -      |
| 3     | 4      | 3      | -      | -      | -      |
| 4     | 5      | 4      | -      | -      | -      |
| 5     | 5      | 5      | 2      | -      | -      |
| 6     | 5      | 5      | 3      | -      | -      |
| 7     | 5      | 5      | 3      | 2      | -      |
| 8     | 5      | 5      | 4      | 3      | -      |
| 9     | 6      | 6      | 4      | 3      | 1      |

The Priest starts with a number of Miracles they know from their past life, but in order to learn more they must define the Pillars of their faith. Each Pillar is an overarching idea which defines their view of their reality represented by about a sentence at the start. As the Priest becomes more sure of their dogma they will incorporate new ideas into new Pillars of Rank One and improve the Ranks of old ones, adding on sentence by sentence. Each time a Pillar is added or increased in Rank the Priest learns two new Miracles which they can choose to cast. These Miracles will be related to the beliefs of the Pillar which they add to, and the Miracles Ranks will also be determined by the Rank of the Pillar (as is outlined in the chart below).

The Priest cannot add Pillars and increase their ranks at their whim though, they can only do so by gaining Enlightenment. The Priest's Enlightenment is an integer which starts at zero and increases whenever they act in accordance with the Pillars they have already defined and decreases it whenever the Priest acts against them. It increase by a number equal to the Rank of whatever Pillar they act in accordance with or decreases by the same amount if they act in conflict with their dogma. At the end of each session the Priest may spend their Enlightenment to either gain a new Pillar or increase the Rank of one. As more and more Pillars are acquired the price of getting a new one will increase. Similarly as a Pillar increases in Rank the price to increase its Rank will also increase. If a Priest ends a session with less than 0 Enlightenment they must remove a Rank from one of their pillars instead. This refunds the same amount of Enlightenment which it would take to buy the same increase at the time.

#### Cost of Gaining a New Pillar

| Current Number of Pillars | Enlightenment Cost |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 0                         | 0                  | 
| 1                         | 1                  | 
| 2                         | 3                  | 
| 3                         | 6                  | 
| 4                         | 10                 | 
| 5                         | 15                 | 
| 6                         | 21                 | 
| 7                         | 28                 | 
| 8                         | 36                 | 
| 9                         | 45                 | 

#### Cost and Effect of Ranking up

| Desired Rank | Cost        | Ranks of Added Miracles | 
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------------------- | 
| 1            | Refer Above | 1 and 1                 | 
| 2            | 3           | 2 and 1                 | 
| 3            | 6           | 3 and 2                 | 
| 4            | 10          | 4 and 3                 | 
| 5            | 15          | 5 and 4                 | 

If the Priest as cast all of their Miracles of a Rank they can't use any more until they have a chance to recharge them. The Priest gets their power back by preaching, lecturing, and discussing their ideology and understanding of the world. For Rank One Miracles this can be as simple as the Priest lecturing themselves for an hour about how they should behave, but Rank Two requires talking to someone else. Ranks 3 and 4 must involve sermons of ever growing importance with Rank 5 being closest to releasing a new chapter of a holy book or performing a Mega-Church sermon in a stadium.

The Priest can also cast a Miracle they have learned which is of a Rank higher than they would normally have access to. This, however, requires them to get together a significant number of resources in a place which is significant to the Pillar of the Miracle they want to cast and to perform a similarly significant ritual. The exact details of how this all works out will have to be discussed when it comes up, but its fair to say this is not intended to be easy or easily repeatable.

### Philosophical BS
The power of the Priest comes from their knowledge of the importance of ideas. Not just knowledge of what is, but of the frameworks and understandings which we put together to represent these things. If they were to write a book it would be called Maps of Meaning,  and it would detail how to create an ideology which could change the way that people look at the world around them. They are able to shape these ideas and understand and effect reality in a way that someone who didn't understand this never could.
