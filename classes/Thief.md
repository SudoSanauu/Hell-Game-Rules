# The Thief

### Description
The Thief stole with from whomever they desired with not a care in the world, spending weeks and going days without rest to take well earned prizes from their victims. This eventually all came crashing down when they acquired knowledge they shouldn't have, and brought about their own demise.

The Thief's power is to steal not only physical objects, but also the have access to take from the Material, Mind, and Mouth of anything or one encountered in Hell.  

With the Thief, you are never at a dead end and can gain something more with just a little risk and clever use of your powers. However, all this requires keeping in mind and organizing what you know about the other members of Hell along with what you have taken from them.

Examples: Cugel the Clever from Vance's Dying Earth

### Traits
#### Obsessed ● ● ○ ○ ○
The Thief is single minded in their approach to tasks and often suffers from tunnel vision and chases goals even after it becomes impractical to do so. This character is the sort of person who would pull two all nighters to finish their project right before it was due or would stalk a prospective romantic partner over weeks in order to set up "accidentally" bumping into them and using their gained knowledge to convince them to go on a first date.  
● – Can check to ignore "distractions" when working on and continuing an obsession.  
● ● – Can freely follow and track one designated "goal" or "target" even as this would normally become all but impossible.

#### Inquisitive ● ○ ○ ○ ○
The Thief is relentlessly curious about the world and people around them, and explores those ideas vigorously. This character is the sort of person who would actually be interested in your obscure thesis or would ask embarrassingly personal questions about you in public. 
● – Can check to get answers from the DM about things that they probably shouldn't know through investigation.

### Theft
As the Thief, you can "steal" anything you know about. This can be from people, places, things, organizations; pretty much any reasonable noun. The most basic version of this involves simply taking objects you can see from the entity in question. If you want something which isn't visible or you don't know about, you can instead perform a "pat down" to try to get knowledge of the objects the target has on them. The same basic principles apply to taking knowledge from the involved party, or understanding their relationships with others. 

The Thief can go deeper than this, not just taking the surface effects of the Material, Mind, and Mouth, but instead stealing aspects core to them. This once again requires knowledge of what is intended to be stolen, which again can be gained through a "pat down" or information gathering check. Once the Thief has an understanding of the properties of the target's Material, the Traits of their Mind, or the Adjectives of their Mouth, they can take what grants the character those properties. This can either take them away from the effected entity for a given time, provide them to the Thief for some duration, or to provide the Thief with a "token" of what has been stolen to put on their character sheet for use at another time. Some examples of what can be taken are taking the spit of a Dragon to allow you to breathe fire like one (Material), telling a guard a confusing story about renovations in the base so they loose their orientation (Mind), or picking up the mannerisms of a Pit Fiend in order to emulate their pompousness at a later date (Mouth).

All of this is done with a check with success occurring on a 10 or higher. The level of success determines how long it will take the target to realize they've been swindled (chart below) in addition to how long before stolen "abilities" will expire. Every previous theft in the encounter will cause a -1 on the next roll, as your repeated suspicious actions become more and more likely to attract attention. Thefts against especially powerful or aware entities may have addition penalties, and strategies taking advantage of the flaws or weaknesses of the target, the surroundings, environment, or using previously acquired resources could provide bonuses.  
Just like other actions in this campaign, the details of how the theft is approached should be described and spelled out. This can involve describing how pockets are picked, the lines given to convince someone to divulge sensitive information, or how one studies and imitates another's mannerisms and style.

### Source of Power
The power of the Thief comes from their understanding that the concept of individual ownership is not as important as we think it is. Of course this is clear when you take physical objects from people, but it is also true of stealing ideas, copying looks or style, and appropriating techniques and approaches. Even if one has a quality, that does not mean that they alone are that quality, or that it can not be taken from them. By understanding that one does not own beauty, the Thief is able to be beautiful like no one else is.
