# The Performer

### Description
The Performer was once a successful artist who, upon reaching the top became corrupted by fame. They abused their powers while doing everything they could to keep others down and hide their sins. Eventually their misdeeds got out, which led to their demise.

As the Performer, you can determine the reality of Hell. You can create places to go or things to find, changing the game everyone is playing.

With the Performer, you are able to rewrite the world allowing yourself the most freedom. However, you also have to figure out what changes you want for yourself and Hell instead of following a predetermined path.

Examples: Like any of the horrible artists you hear about on this godforsaken planet. everyone is problematic. everyone is canceled. Bockjack, Horseman, obviously.

### Traits
#### Liar ● ● ○ ○ ○
The Performer is someone who takes the truth to be less absolute than most. This character is the sort of person who would have no problems covering for a friend with a convincing story or would always have a just unlikely enough reason for any mistake they make.  
● – Can check to create evidence for something out of nothing.  
● ● – Can create an object or idea out of nothing. Repeated or flagrant use of this power may fail.

#### Inspirational ● ○ ○ ○ ○
The Performer is someone whose actions and creations help others see the world in another light. This character is the sort of person who would help a friend get out of a funk by showing them a new song or get so wrapped up in creating a gift for someone that they neglected their actual relationship.  
● – Can check to communicate to an ally a perspective or idea they didn't have before, allowing them to reroll a non-combat check.

### Imagination
As the Performer you understand better than anyone the power of stories, especially in Hell. In your life you practiced being able to communicate your truth, and bringing it into the world for everyone to see. This allows you to do the same in Hell, bringing your truth onto the plane for you to take advantage of.  

The Performer's powers are uniquely versatile in that they are able to directly create whatever truth they see fit within the world. How this plays out is once per Level the Performer can tell everyone involved in the game something they want to be true, where they heard the rumor of this truth from, who they've spread the it to, and/or what they hope to get out of it. Once they've outlined all of this they can work on their own personal performance of this idea or rumor. Word will spread of this performance and what it means and either by the next session or the one after that this new story will have woven itself into the reality of Hell, becoming as true as anything else.  
The exact nature of what is put into the world will vary based on how its described, who the information goes through, and how well or poorly it meshes with the rest of Hell's ecosystem. In general, these rumors will allow the Performer to get access to something that can either permanently grant them additional power or that they otherwise couldn't get their hands on. Given the unreliable nature of reality in Hell this will not always be exactly what the Performer thinks it is or intends it to be, but it will probably be related. In addition, since nothing in Hell is free any benefit that the Performer wants to accrue from their rumor will generally have to be earned.

For example, if the Performer were a musician who was fed up of getting shown up in fights they may invent a story about a magic sword which fights for its owner as long as they are singing. After coming up with this story they start spreading the rumor around the local pub saying they heard from an ancient wise man say the sword was brought to Hell by its previous owner (a notorious pirate named Petey who would always sing out of tune). After running their mouth for a while they may even make up a song about Petey and the life he lived with his magic sword. After a few sessions the Performer could find themselves approached by an ancient crumbling Lost Soul who claims that she was Petey's crew mate and could lead the party there in exchange for one the party joining her on one last plunder.  
This romp may end with the Performer meeting Petey, getting his sword, and the sword doing what the Performer thought, but more likely is that only some of these things happen. In general the outcome and journey will probably be along the lines of what the Performer is looking for, but it almost certainly won't be exactly the same.


### Source of Power
The power of the Bard comes from their belief in the power and reality of their own stories. The Bard is an artist who believes that what they say is true and worth sharing. For this reason, in Hell their story is true and worth sharing, meaning they have the ability to sculpt their own reality in a way no other character has.
