# The Performer

### Description
The Performer was once a successful artist who, upon reaching the top became corrupted by fame. They abused their powers while doing everything they could to keep others down and hide their sins. Eventually their misdeeds got out, which led to their demise.

As the Performer, you can determine the reality of Hell. You can create places to go or things to find, changing the game everyone is playing.

With the Performer, you are able to rewrite the world allowing yourself the most freedom. However, you also have to figure out what changes you want for yourself and Hell instead of following a predetermined path.

Examples: Like any of the horrible artists you hear about on this godforsaken planet. everyone is problematic. everyone is canceled.

### Traits
#### Liar ● ● ○ ○ ○
The Performer is someone who takes the truth to be less absolute than most. This character is the sort of person who would have no problems covering for a friend with a convincing story or would always have a just unlikely enough reason for any mistake they make.  
● – Can check to create evidence for something out of nothing.  
● ● – Can create an object or idea. Repeated or flagrant use of this power may fail.

#### Inspirational ● ○ ○ ○ ○
The Performer is someone whose actions and creations help others see the world in another light. This character is the sort of person who would help a friend get out of a funk by showing them a new song or get so wrapped up in creating a gift for someone that they neglected their actual relationship.  
● – Can check to give an ally a perspective or idea they didn't have before, allowing them to reroll a non-combat check.

### Imagination
As the Performer you understand better than anyone the power of stories, especially in Hell. In your life you practiced being able to communicate your truth, and bring in into the world for everyone to see. In Hell, this gives you the ability to change what is and isn't true.  
The Performer's powers are uniquely versatile in that they are able to directly create whatever truth they see fit within the world. How this plays out is once per Level the Performer can tell everyone involved in the game something they want to be true and where they heard this rumor from, who they've spread the it to, and/or what they hope to get out of it. Then, by either the next session or the one after that this new story will be somehow woven into the reality of Hell, becoming as true as anything else.  
The exact nature of what exactly is put into the world will vary based on how its described, who the information goes through, and how well or poorly it meshes with the rest of Hell's ecosystem. In general, these rumors will allow the Performer to get access to something which can either permanently grant them access to additional power or something which otherwise couldn't be received; however, given the unreliable nature of reality in Hell this will not always be exactly what the Performer thinks or intends it to be. In addition, since nothing in Hell is free any benefit that the Performer wants to accrue from their rumor will generally have to be earned or explored.


### Philosophical BS
The power of the Bard comes from their belief in the power and reality of their own story and truth. The Bard is an artist who believes that what they say is true and worth sharing. For this reason, in Hell their story is true and worth sharing, meaning they have the ability to sculpt their own reality in a way no other character has.
