# The Lord

### Description
The Lord was once a passionate leader who cared deeply for their domain and ruled over it as best they could. Eventually this was used against them, and they were manipulated into making terrible decisions which eventually led to not only their demise, but also that of their subjects.  

The Lord's power is to be able to gain the trust of others and to act as their leader. The Lord must balance their strength against their Underling's loyalty and desires.  

With the Lord, you can lead and work with any of the denizens of Hell, gaining their expertise and power as your own. However, in order to keep it you have to manage conflicting groups with conflicting interests whose priorities can be opposite yours.  

Examples: Edelgard von Hresvelg from FE:3H, Most GoT Characters, the Player from King of Dragon Pass

### Traits
#### Rash ● ● ○ ○ ○
The Lord is confident in themselves and makes decisions quickly with the information they have on hand. This character is the sort of person who would dive in front of a train to save a baby or bet all their savings on a hunch.  
● – Can check to escape any situation, as long as they do so by barreling into another situation which they know even less about.  
● ● – Can blurt out their action in order to act before everyone else when starting something new.

#### Responsible ● ○ ○ ○ ○
The Lord is used to having the world rest on their shoulders. This character is the sort of person who would be willing to stay late in order to finish up something they knew needed to get done or take on an overwhelming and impossible task and destroy themselves trying to achieve it.  
● – Can check to shift responsibility of events to themselves or those who report to them.

### Authority
As the Lord, your power comes from your ability to command and direct others. Everyone knows that you alone have what it takes to lead an organization to its fullest potential, and so they are willing to pledge themselves to you and put their fate in your hands.

The confidence that you can inspire in those that follow you is represented by your Authority. This is equal to 10 per level +1 for each rank of each Adjective or Trait which you posses (so at the start this will be 10 + 2 + 1 = 13). This number represents how much respect you can demand from your Underlings and how much power you can lay claim to before Hell starts to question you. Most increases due to public perception or titles can be represented by the additional points gained from Adjectives or Traits increasing Rank, but there may be some other situations where outside events provide another opportunity to increase authority.

Each entity which could serve the Lord will come with a basic write up detailing exactly what they are and what they can do. This write up will generally have their general combat statistics along with a list of actions they can add their full and half bonuses to and what special powers or privileges (if any) they posses. All of these numbers will culminate in a Power rating which corisponds to the amount of influence and skill they can provide to the Lord. If the Lord is recruiting from a group instead of individuals then the Power of the group is increased another time for every time their size doubles (Look at the Power Multiplier by Number of Entities chart for a better explanation).

__Power Multiplier by Number of Entities__  

| Number | Multiplier |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 1      | 1          |
| 2+     | 2          |
| 4+     | 3          |
| 8+     | 4          |
| 16+    | 5          |
| 32+    | 6          |
| 64+    | 7          |
| 128+   | 8          |
| 256+   | 9          |
| 512+   | 10         |
| 1024+  | 11         |

If the Lord decides that they want to recruit that entity or group of entities they will need to move onto looking at what they desire and respect instead. If the Lord can manage to provide to the entities what they desire and prove to them that the Lord is worthy of respect they can recruit them as Underlings. Once they join the Lord as an Underling they acquire a Mood, another number which represents their opinion of the Lord at that given time. If the Lord continues proving themselves to be worthy and fulfilling the desires of these Underlings this number can go up, while if they do the opposite it will go down. If the Lord manages to do especially well or poorly in providing for their Underlings their Power may even change.  

While more followers to boss around are always nice the Lord can only have influence over so many Underlings at one time. If the sum of all Underling's Power adjusted by their Mood ever is greater than the Lord's Authority, problems will begin to occur. These can be simple logistical and bureaucratic problems with the Lord's system (Underling's attempting to get attention from the Lord for their problems) or Underling's explicitly acting against the Lord's interests to punish or annoy the Lord for not doing what the Underlings want. The Lord also can't recruit an Underling if doing so would push the Power and Mood sum above the Lord's authority.

In addition each Underling's opinion of the Lord can also cause problems. If any Underling's opinion becomes too low they will begin causing problems for the Lord, including acting against orders, refusing commands, or even leaving the Lord all together. Anytime an Underling's Mood is negative minor problems will abound. Reaching -10 will cause any Underling to pack up and leave the Lord behind, with this coming one point sooner for every 10 Power an Underling has.


### Source of Power
The power of the Lord comes from their belief that they should be the one to lead. Whether inherited through birthright or earned through practice, the Lord knows that they should be in charge. Though they are not above getting their hands dirty, they know that their place is at the head of the table, giving orders, passing judgment, and planning big plans. This gives them dominion over those looking for someone to give their services too and looking for someone who is fit to rule.
