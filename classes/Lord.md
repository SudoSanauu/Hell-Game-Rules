# The Lord

### Description
The Lord was once a passionate leader who cared deeply for their domain and ruled over it as best they could. Eventually this was used against them, and they were manipulated into making terrible decisions which eventually led to not only their demise, but also that of their subjects.  

The Lord's power is to be able to gain the trust of others and to act as their leader. The Lord must balance their strength against their Underling's loyalty and desires.  

With the Lord, you can lead and work with any of the denizens of Hell, gaining their expertise and power as your own. However, in order to keep it you have to manage conflicting groups with conflicting interests whose priorities can be opposite yours.  

Examples: Edelgard von Hresvelg from FE:3H, Most GoT Characters, the Player from King of Dragon Pass

### Traits
#### Rash ● ● ○ ○ ○
The Lord is confident in themselves and makes decisions quickly with the information they have on hand. This character is the sort of person who would dive in front of a train to save a baby or bet all their savings on a hunch.  
● – Can check to escape any situation, as long as they do so by barreling into another situation which they know even less about  
● ● – Can blurt out their action in order to act before everyone else when starting something new.

#### Responsible ● ○ ○ ○ ○
The Lord is DESCRIPTION. This character is the sort of person who would be willing to stay late in order to finish up something they knew needed to get done or take on an overwhelming and impossible task and destroy themselves trying to achieve it.  
● – Can check to shift responsibility of events to themselves or those who report to them.

### Authority
As the Lord, your power comes from your ability to command and direct others. Everyone knows that you alone have what it takes to lead an organization to its fullest potential, and so are willing to pledge themselves to you and put their fate in your hands.

The confidence that you can inspire in those that follow you is represented by your Authority. This is equal to 10 * lvl, with + 1 for each rank of each Adjective or Trait which you posses (so at the start this will be 10\*1 + 2 + 1 = 13). This number represents how much respect you can demand and how much you can lay claim to before Hell starts to question you. Most increases due to public perception or titles can be represented by the additional points gained from Adjectives or Traits increasing Rank, but there may be some other situations where outside events provide another opportunity to increase authority.

__Talk about getting Underlings to join and the deal with players joining?__

Each entity which could serve the Lord will have a Power rating which corisponds to the amount of influence and skill they possess. A good starting point for this number is the Hit Dice of the creature in question, though this will vary depending on the creature in question, so make sure to ask the entity or someone in charge for details. If the entity is actually a group of entities, then their Power is increased another time for ever time the size doubles. (For instance, if a Mail Goblin has a power of 3, 2 such Mail Goblins would have a power of 6, 4 would have a Power of 9, 8 would have a Power of 12, ect.) If said entity joins the Lord they instead become an Underling with a Mood, which represents their opinion of the Lord at that given time. This is represented by an integer, which can either be positive or negative (or zero). If any Underling's opinion becomes too low they will begin causing problems for the lord, including acting against orders, refusing commands, or even leaving the Lord all together.  
The Lord can also only have influence over so many Underlings at one time. If the sum of all Underling's Power adjusted by their Mood ever is greater than the Lord's Authority, problems will begin to occur. These can be simple logistical and bureaucratic problems with the Lord's system, Underling's attempting to get attention from the Lord for their problems, or Underling's explicitly acting against the Lord's interests because they think the Lord won't notice. The Lord also can't recruit an Underling if doing so would push the Power and Mood sum above the Lord's authority.


Authority = lvl * 5 + Trait lvl + Adj lvl

Power = HD * (Log_2(# of people) + 1)

Mood is +/- modifier
	if mood <= -10 + (Power/10) then problems

if Sum(Power - Mood) > Authority then you minions start to rebel and cause problems. if its more than lvl GT then one will leave/rebel/whatever and cause all sorts of problems.





### Philosophical BS
The power of the Lord comes from their belief that they should be the one to lead. Whether inherited through birthright or earned through practice, the Lord knows that they should be in charge. Though they are not above getting their hands dirty, they know that their place is at the head of the table, giving orders, passing judgment, and planning big plans. This gives them dominion over those looking for someone to give their services too and looking for someone who is fit to rule.
