# Rules Cyclopedia

This is the place where I will be writing a bunch of quick reference notes for how the rules work in a situation. It will not be a good place to look to learn new rules or get a good description of how they work, but if you forget exactly how bonuses are added or want a quick refresher this document will hopefully be easier to quickly parse than the "Players Handbook".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### AC:
10 + Dex mod + Armor


### Adjectives:
+ Rank to action which aligns with Adj  
at Rank 3/5 choose a roll/stat which you wouldn't normally be able to add to and add to that too (AC [vs stronger monsters @ 3], Damage [with an ax @ 3] , Initiative, ect)  
at Rank 2/4 get cool special effects which happen whenever you use the Adjective bonus


### Initiative:
d20 + dex Mod


### Leveling:
5xp, expect 1 xp every other session about


### Save DC's:
10 + lvl + ability mod + adj Rank
