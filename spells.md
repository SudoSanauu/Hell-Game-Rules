This is a list of all the spells for all the characters which are known at character creation.

### Genius Spells
#### Rank 1
_Read the Signs/Wizard Eyes_  
This Spell allows the caster to read the nature of phenomenon normally too ephemeral or esoteric to easily observe. This includes being able to comprehend magical runes, learn adjectives of artifacts, or understand effects of powerful abilities.

_Present/Wizard Grab_  
This Spell allows the Genius to magically cause an object which is visible within 10 feet of them to appear in their hand. If there are complications (intervening objects, partial view, tightly held/fastened objects, ect.) then the Spell has a chance to fail. This Spell can also be cast in reverse to instead magically place an object in the Genius' hand somewhere within 10 feet, with the same restrictions.

_Stick/Wizard Glue_  
This Spell causes the Genius to be able to create a thick, gooey substance which hardens after a round into an all but unbreakable adhesive. This glue can be made for 1 round/lvl of the Genius after casting.

_Grease/Wizard Grease_  
This Spell allows the Genius to spread a slippery and flammable oil like substance over an area or object. Handling greased objects or walking on greased surfaces is incredibly difficult, and requires regular checks to avoid failure. Each casting provides enough grease to cover about an 100 sq. ft. area plus 10 sq. ft. /lvl of the Genius.

_Fog/Wizard Mist_  
This Spell allows the Genius to create a thick soupy mist which lowers visibility to about 10 feet and hampers the effects of fires. The Genius can make 100,000 cub. ft. plus another 10,000 cub. ft./lvl, and the fog lasts about an hour.

_Escape/Wizard Legs_  
This Spell give the Genius' target powerful locomotion abilities allowing them to run and jump about twice as fast or far as normal. This effect lasts about 1 hour/lvl of the Genius.

_Dancing Lights/Wizard Orbs_  
This spells creates a few flying glowy orbs which the Genius can control. These orbs can fly at a rapid pace anywhere the Genius can see, can provide reasonable illumination, and last as long as the Genius is able to concentrate on them.


### Priest Miracles
#### Rank 1
_Bless_  
With this Miracle the Priest is able to perform a ceremony taking a minute which fixes, tunes up, sanctifies, and otherwise helps out a person, place, or thing. All functions of that entity will get a +1 till they fail a check (or are used to fail a check), at which point the bonus disappears till the Miracle is cast anew.

_Cure Wounds_  
With this Miracle the Priest can lay their hands on someone to immediately heal them for 2d6 + lvl HP. If the Priest heals 10 or more HP they may elect to heal a wound instead (serious wounds may only be partially healed).

_Diagnose_  
With this Miracle the Priest is able to look at something and is immediately able to explain what it is and what is wrong with it from their perspective. This will of course change based on what exactly the Priest perspective and Pillars are, and so will never be unbiased, though it also always has at least a hint of the truth.

_Endure_  
With this Miracle the Priest can choose to allow one other entity to endure the hardship of one specific thing, be it fire, hammers, or harsh words. This will provide a +2 to any rolls or defenses by the entity against the thing for 1 hour/lvl of the Priest.

_Rebuke_  
With this Miracle the Priest is able to banish and destroy blasphemous and weak creatures around them. All creatures ideologically opposed (including "allies") within 100 feet of the Priest and in their line of sight are effected based on their hit points. If the creature currently has less than half the Priest hit points they are immediately defeated on the spot. If they just have less HP than the priest they are simply compelled to leave, and will suffer a -2 penalty to everything if they don't. If they have more hit points than the Priest does they are unaffected except to be rightfully annoyed at the Priest.

### Rebel Charms
#### Rank 1
_Envigor_  
This Charm causes one creature touched to be filled with magically good vibes. These vibes last 8 hours + 2 hour/lvl, during which time the recipient slowly gets better, gaining a hit point per hour. The recipient can also give up 10 hours worth of hit points to heal a wound (may require multiple 10 hour stints if wound is serious).

_Enticing Aura_  
This Charm causes an item to appear incredibly attractive, desirable, and valuable to entities looking for a specific thing 1 hour/lvl. A value of 100 SP/lvl won't arouse any suspicion, but a more valuable or very specific type of item may allow a save to realize the item is fake. Who it effects and what form the item's attraction takes should be described by the caster upon time of casting.

_Sleep_  
This Charm causes 3 hit dice/levels of people to fall asleep for a minute per level of the Rebel. All the targets have to be within 100 ft of the caster and within a 30ft diamater circle. If a creature is only partially effected they are aloud a Wisdom save with +1 for each unaffected HD they posses. Lost soul's HD count for double, while Fiend's count for triple.

_Understand_  
This Charm allows the Rebel to cut through the shit of whatever they cast it on and understand what is really going on. If cast on an item or location it will give an overview of its history and what its uses have been and could be. If cast on a person or a message the Rebel understands what is being communicated instead of what is being said, and can usually suss out any lies which are being said.

_Clean_  
Cleans, washes, picks up, and applies simple substances to one entity or 10ft cube per lvl.
